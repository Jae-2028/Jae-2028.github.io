        <p> My Unit Two project is a website I created about Filipino desserts. This is an example of my best work because I fully understood the coding concepts and how to make everything look the way I wanted it to. It was a project I felt truly proud of after completing it. I created something that felt personal and meaningful to me.</p>
        <p> What makes this work stand out is how it reflects my culture and creativity. I chose to build a website about Filipino desserts, which allowed me to share something important to me. I was proud of how I organized the content, explained each dessert, and even included recipes. The design and structure of the site were completely my own, and that made the final result unique.</p>
        <p> I found this project to be relatively easy because I was confident in my vision and how to execute it. Even though I encountered some challenges where some pieces of code were difficult for me to figure out, I was still able to solve the problem with patience.</p>
        <p>With my knowledge of HTML tags and creativity, I was able to create a web page that was both well-structured and visually appealing, clearly and engagingly presenting the information and recipe.</p>
