        <p>For my Unit Three project, I created an interactive game where the player builds a pizza by catching toppings and avoiding trash. This project demonstrates my growth in coding because it brought together everything I had learned into one piece. When I first started coding in Game Lab, it was confusing and difficult to understand. However, over time, I began to get the hang of it, and this game shows that progress. I encountered a few obstacles, such as making the trash take away lives every time it touches the player. The hardest thing for me to master was changing the score and number of lives because it was difficult to understand and complicated. I was able to overcome these challenges by trial and error, seeing what worked and what didn’t. My consistent effort on this project helped me stay focused and work through challenges, which directly led to my success in creating a fully functional game. If I could go back and improve the project, I’d add more features like a timer, sound effects, or maybe increasing difficulty over time. But overall, this game helped me grow more confident in using all the programming tools I’ve learned so far.</p>
