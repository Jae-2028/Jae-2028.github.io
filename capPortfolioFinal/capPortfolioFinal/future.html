        <p> Throughout this class, I’ve learned many valuable skills, such as how to read and write code, think logically, and use problem-solving strategies to persevere through challenges and debug code. These skills have helped me learn how to break down problems step by step. I can apply this way of thinking to subjects like math, where clear reasoning and problem-solving are essential. I want to use these skills and my computer science knowledge to bring my ideas to life and solve real-world problems by designing apps that combine both my interests and the user's needs to create something original and meaningful. During this asynchronous class, not only did my confidence in computer science grow, but I have learned that I am capable of working independently and teaching myself new skills. Even though I am confident in my computer science knowledge, I feel that I can still improve on my coding organization and using loops and variables more effectively. To grow in these areas, I plan on continuing to practice on my own by watching tutorials and working on small projects that target my weak areas. With a strong foundation now in place, I’m ready to keep growing and exploring new possibilities in computer science</p>
