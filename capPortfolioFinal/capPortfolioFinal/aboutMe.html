    <h3>Hello! My name is Jaelynn Palma!</h3>
   <p>Growing up, I’ve always been interested in creating things and understanding how they work. Computer science has helped me express that interest through coding and problem-solving. Aside from my coding, I also enjoy playing basketball and engaging in hands-on activities such as crafting.</p>
   <p> This portfolio showcases the work I’ve completed during the Introduction to Computer Science course. It demonstrates how I’ve grown both as a problem-solver and a coder. Throughout the course, I’ve faced challenges, made progress, and developed valuable skills. </p>
   <p>When I first started this class, I didn’t know much about coding. At times, I was confused and stuck. However, I eventually learned to understand and break down problems and think logically. With each project, I built more confidence in using programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, variables, and functions. Computer science has taught me how to approach problems with patience and creativity. As I kept practicing, I became more comfortable turning ideas into working projects. Now, I feel more confident in my coding skills and proud of the progress I’ve made throughout the course</p>
